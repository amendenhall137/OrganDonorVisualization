        Though the number of transplants has increased, the rate of addition of people to the organ transplant waiting list has increased as well. 
        Though private insurance is the most common method of payment for the transplant procedure, using alternative payment methods such as Medicare or 
        Medicaid does not decrease a person’s likelihood of receiving a transplant. Use the bar graph below to see how common transplant payment options 
        vary over time. Additionally, see within each payment method the fatal discrepancy between waitlist additions and transplants.

        As we just saw, many people are removed from the organ transplant waiting list every year. Although occasionally <br>
        the reason for removal is recovery, more often the person dies before they are able to receive a transplant. <br>
        Our final scene shows the painful reality of mortalities of those on the organ transplant waiting list.
